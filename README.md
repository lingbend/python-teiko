### b
Based on this limited sample size, I would not be very confident in this data. However, based on the available data, all of the cell groups differ significantly except for the cd8 t-cells for the following reasons:

The 100% of the responsive b-cells are present in greater percentages than over 50% of the non-responsive b-cells.

The overlap in percentages between the responsive and non-responsive cd8 t-cells are nearly identical with the first, second, and third quartiles of each being close together.

Nearly 100% of the responsive cd4 t-cells are present in higher percentages than almost 100% of the non-responsive cd4 t-cells.

Nearly 75% percent of the responsive nk cells are present in higher percentages than all of the non-responseive couterparts.

Lastly, roughly 75% of the non-responsive monocytes are present in higher numbers than the all of the responsive monocytes.
